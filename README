tmpclone clones a source code repository temporarily.
The goal is to browse a repository quickly, without actually saving it.
It can also be useful to create a patch.

It is very fast as it uses /tmp (usually in tmpfs)
and does not fetch the whole history.
When you are done, the repository is removed.

Usage: tmpclone <repo URL> [<branch, tag or commit>]

For now, only git is supported.
